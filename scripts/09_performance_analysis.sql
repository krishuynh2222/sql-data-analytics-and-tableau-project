Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month) - PostgreSQL
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - Measure product performance over time.
    - Benchmark vs product average.
    - Track year-over-year trends and growth.

PostgreSQL Functions Used:
    - EXTRACT(): get year from date
    - LAG(): access previous row
    - AVG() OVER(): window average
    - CASE: conditional logic
